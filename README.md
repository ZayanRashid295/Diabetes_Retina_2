Developed a deep-learning based pipeline to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy from high-resolution retinal fundus images. The solution includes model training (leveraging CNN architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3), image preprocessing and transfer learning, and a Flask-based web app for inference deployment. I implemented a full end‐to‐end system including data ingestion, augmentation, model fine-tuning, inference endpoint, and visualization of results. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable AI systems in the healthcare domain from research through deployment to real-world use.
